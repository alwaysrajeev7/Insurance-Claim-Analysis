# Insurance Claim EDA Project
# About
- This project is an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project on an Insurance Claim dataset. The dataset contains information about insurance policyholders, including their demographics, medical history, and details about their insurance claims.
- The goal of this project is to perform exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the factors influencing insurance claims, identify patterns and trends, and visualize the data to communicate findings effectively.

# Disclaimer
- As a beginner, I have attempted to analyze the dataset using the concepts I have learned so far. However, I acknowledge that there may be areas for improvement in my approach and analysis. I am committed to continuing my learning journey and refining my skills, and I will strive to make future projects even more polished and insightful.
